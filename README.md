🎯 Number Guessing Game — Python Project
📘 Overview

The Number Guessing Game is a simple yet fun Python project that allows users to test their guessing skills.
In this game, the computer randomly selects a number within a defined range, and the player tries to guess it.
After each attempt, the program provides hints like “Too high” or “Too low” until the player finds the correct number.

This project demonstrates the use of Python fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, user input, and random number generation.

🧠 Key Concepts Covered

Python loops (while and for)

Conditional statements (if-elif-else)

Random module for number generation

User input handling

Basic logic and flow control

⚙️ How It Works

The program randomly generates a number within a specific range (e.g., 1 to 1000).

The player enters their guess.

The program compares the player’s guess with the generated number:

Prints “Too high!” if the guess is greater.

Prints “Too low!” if the guess is smaller.

The loop continues until the player guesses correctly.

The total number of attempts is displayed at the end.

🧩 Example Output
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 1000.
Enter your guess: 45
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 73
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 56
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.

🚀 How to Run

You can run this project in Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE:

# If using terminal
python Number_guessing_game_.py


Or open the notebook in Jupyter:

jupyter notebook Number_guessing_game_.ipynb

💡 Improvements You Can Try

Add difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)

Keep score or timer

Allow multiple rounds

Create a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt

Store player statistics (number of attempts, best score, etc.)

🧰 Requirements

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook (optional, for .ipynb version)

To install Jupyter:

pip install notebook
